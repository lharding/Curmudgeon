## Now With Javascript! Over [here](https://github.com/lharding/curmudgeon-js)!

Curmudgeon has been superseded in my own use by [Curmudgeon-js](https://github.com/lharding/curmudgeon-js), which is easier to use, uses handlebars instead of mustache, runs post bodies through `marked`, and is much better documented. You almost certainly want that repository instead of this one.

## Old Readme:

Curmudgeon is an opinionated, minimalist blog engine for programmers who just want something to generate a site and get out of the way. It runs against a directory of text files and uses mustache templates to generate a static blog with support for Disqus comments.

The code should be simple enough to be self documenting.
