Curmudgeon is an opinionated, minimalist blog engine for programmers who just want something to generate a site and get out of the way. It runs against a directory of text files and uses mustache templates to generate a static blog with support for Disqus comments.

In a future version I'll write a real readme that actually tells you how to use it, but the code is simple enough that you can probably figure it out from a quick scan of curmudgeon.py.
